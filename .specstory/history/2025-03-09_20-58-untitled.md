ok we have fixed all issues running on coolify server, but we need to correctly configured CORS setting, so I can add Environment variables on coolify dashboard, but looking at our backend is hardcoded for CORS allow_origins.

so I have added Production Environment Variables 

CORS_ORIGINS = ["http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]

_**Assistant**_

<think>Let's analyze the user's request:

1. They've deployed the application on a Coolify server and need to correctly configure CORS settings.
2. Currently, the CORS settings are hardcoded in the code with only localhost origins allowed:
```python
allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
```
3. The user has added a production environment variable called `CORS_ORIGINS` with values:
```
["http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]
```

My task is to modify the code to use this environment variable instead of the hardcoded values. This will require:

1. Reading the environment variable from settings
2. Modifying the CORS middleware configuration to use the value from settings

First, I need to check if the settings module already has support for CORS_ORIGINS, and if not, I'll need to add it.</think>I'll help you update the CORS configuration to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values. This will make your application more flexible when deployed on different environments like your Coolify server.

First, let's check the current settings configuration to see if we already have support for CORS_ORIGINS:

Let's try looking for the settings module in a more standard location for FastAPI applications:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src • **10** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `__pycache__` |
| 📄 `main.py` |
| 📁 `services` |
| 📁 `schemas` |
| 📁 `api` |
| 📁 `core` |
| 📁 `db` |
| 📁 `models` |
| 📄 `__init__.py` |
| 📁 `utils` |

</details>

Let's look in the core directory, as this is a common location for settings in FastAPI applications:

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/core • **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `__pycache__` |
| 📄 `config.py` |
| 📄 `security.py` |
| 📄 `exceptions.py` |
| 📄 `__init__.py` |

</details>

Perfect! Let's check the config.py file as it's likely where our application settings are defined:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

Great! I can see that the configuration is already set up to handle CORS_ORIGINS as an environment variable. The Settings class has:

1. A default value: `CORS_ORIGINS: List[AnyHttpUrl] = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]`
2. A validator that can handle both string and list formats

Now, let's look at how this is used in the main.py file:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

I see the issue now. The main.py file is importing the settings configuration with `from src.core.config import settings`, but in the CORS middleware configuration, it's using hardcoded values instead of the `settings.CORS_ORIGINS` value.

Let's update the CORS configuration in the main.py file to use the settings:

---

_****_

```diff
          CORSMiddleware,
          # Explicitly list allowed origins - don't use wildcard with credentials
-         allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"],
+         allow_origins=settings.CORS_ORIGINS,
          # Only set to True if you need cookies or auth headers
          allow_credentials=False,
```

---

_****_

Perfect! Now your application will use the CORS origins specified in the
