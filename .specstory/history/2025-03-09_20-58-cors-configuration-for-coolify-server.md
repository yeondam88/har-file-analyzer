## CORS Configuration for Coolify Server (3/9/2025, 8:58:59 PM)

_**User**_

ok we have fixed all issues running on coolify server, but we need to correctly configured CORS setting, so I can add Environment variables on coolify dashboard, but looking at our backend is hardcoded for CORS allow_origins.

so I have added Production Environment Variables 

CORS_ORIGINS = ["http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>Let's analyze the user's request:

1. They've deployed the application on a Coolify server and need to correctly configure CORS settings.
2. Currently, the CORS settings are hardcoded in the code with only localhost origins allowed:
```python
allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
```
3. The user has added a production environment variable called `CORS_ORIGINS` with values:
```
["http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]
```

My task is to modify the code to use this environment variable instead of the hardcoded values. This will require:

1. Reading the environment variable from settings
2. Modifying the CORS middleware configuration to use the value from settings

First, I need to check if the settings module already has support for CORS_ORIGINS, and if not, I'll need to add it.</think>I'll help you update the CORS configuration to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values. This will make your application more flexible when deployed on different environments like your Coolify server.

First, let's check the current settings configuration to see if we already have support for CORS_ORIGINS:

No results found
</details>

Let's try looking for the settings module in a more standard location for FastAPI applications:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src ‚Ä¢ **10** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|

| üìÅ `core` |
| üìÅ `db` |
| üìÅ `models` |
| üìÑ `__init__.py` |
| üìÅ `utils` |

</details>

---

_****_

Let's look in the core directory, as this is a common location for settings in FastAPI applications:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/core ‚Ä¢ **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÅ `__pycache__` |
| üìÑ `config.py` |
| üìÑ `security.py` |
| üìÑ `exceptions.py` |
| üìÑ `__init__.py` |

</details>

---

_****_

Perfect! Let's check the config.py file as it's likely where our application settings are defined:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Great! I can see that the configuration is already set up to handle CORS_ORIGINS as an environment variable. The Settings class has:

1. A default value: `CORS_ORIGINS: List[AnyHttpUrl] = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]`
2. A validator that can handle both string and list formats

Now, let's look at how this is used in the main.py file:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

I see the issue now. The main.py file is importing the settings configuration with `from src.core.config import settings`, but in the CORS middleware configuration, it's using hardcoded values instead of the `settings.CORS_ORIGINS` value.

Let's update the CORS configuration in the main.py file to use the settings:

---

_****_

```diff
          CORSMiddleware,
          # Explicitly list allowed origins - don't use wildcard with credentials
-         allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"],
+         allow_origins=settings.CORS_ORIGINS,
          # Only set to True if you need cookies or auth headers
          allow_credentials=False,
```

---

_****_

Perfect! Now your application will use the CORS origins specified in the environment variables instead of the hardcoded values. 

With this change, your Coolify server will accept the CORS_ORIGINS environment variable you've set:
```
CORS_ORIGINS = ["http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]
```

The Pydantic settings configuration already has a validator (`assemble_cors_origins`) that will handle this properly, whether it's provided as a comma-separated string or a list.

This change makes your application more configurable and ensures it will work properly in different environments without code changes.

I have added environment variable but still CORS error not fixed. Can we add a log so we can see to read our env for allowed host? hmm but i am thinking if the request blocked by the browser, then where should we see the log (server side env values) 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is experiencing CORS issues even after setting the environment variables. They want to add logging to verify that the correct CORS settings are being applied, but they're also realizing that if the browser is blocking the request (which is what CORS errors do), they might not see server-side logs for those requests.

Let's add logging to the application startup to print the CORS settings that are being used. This way, they can verify that the environment variables are being properly read by the application.

I should:
1. Add logging at application startup to print the CORS origins that are being used
2. Consider adding more verbose CORS error handling or debugging information
3. Explain why they can still see server logs even if CORS blocks browser requests</think>You're right that CORS errors happen on the browser side, but the server still processes the request - it's the browser that blocks the response due to CORS policy violations. This means we can definitely add server-side logging to see what CORS origins are configured.

Let's add detailed logging to show what CORS settings are being used when the application starts up:

---

_****_

```diff
      
      # Configure CORS - Proper configuration following best practices
+     logger.info(f"Configuring CORS with allowed origins: {settings.CORS_ORIGINS}")
      application.add_middleware(
          CORSMiddleware,
```

---

_****_

Now let's add some additional debug information to help understand CORS issues. Let's create a special endpoint that can be used to debug CORS-related settings:

---

_****_

```diff
      application.include_router(api_router, prefix="/api")
      
+     # Debug endpoint to check CORS settings
+     @application.get("/debug/cors", include_in_schema=False)
+     async def debug_cors():
+         """Endpoint to debug CORS settings"""
+         return {
+             "cors_origins": settings.CORS_ORIGINS,
+             "allowed_hosts": settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS,
+             "info": "If you can see this response in your browser, CORS is working for this origin."
+         }
+     
      # Add exception handlers
      @application.exception_handler(HARFileException)
```

---

_****_

Let's also add some more detailed error handling for debugging purposes. We'll add logging of incoming requests with their origins to help diagnose CORS issues:

---

_****_

```diff
      application.include_router(api_router, prefix="/api")
      
+     # Add middleware to log request origins for CORS debugging
+     @application.middleware("http")
+     async def log_request_origin(request: Request, call_next):
+         origin = request.headers.get("origin", "No origin header")
+         logger.info(f"Request received from origin: {origin}, path: {request.url.path}")
+         response = await call_next(request)
+         return response
+     
      # Debug endpoint to check CORS settings
      @application.get("/debug/cors", include_in_schema=False)
```

---

_****_

These changes will help debug the CORS issues:

1. Added logging that shows the configured CORS origins when the application starts
2. Added a middleware that logs the origin of each incoming request
3. Added a debug endpoint (`/debug/cors`) that returns the current CORS settings

Here are some additional things to check:

1. **Environment Variable Format**: Make sure the environment variable format is correct. The `CORS_ORIGINS` in config.py is expecting either a comma-separated string or a JSON list. In Coolify, you might need to format it as a comma-separated string:
   ```
   CORS_ORIGINS=http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Check the Protocol**: Ensure you're using the correct protocol (http vs https). If your site is served over HTTPS, the origins should also use HTTPS.

3. **Testing the CORS Configuration**: You can test if the CORS configuration is working by accessing the `/debug/cors` endpoint directly from your browser. If you can see the JSON response, it means CORS is working for that origin.

4. **Checking CORS Headers**: You can use the browser's developer tools (Network tab) to see if the server is returning the proper CORS headers for the OPTIONS request (preflight) and the actual request.

After deploying these changes, check the logs to see:
- What CORS origins are configured at startup
- What origins are actually sending requests
- Any discrepancies between the two

The middleware will help you see if the request is even reaching the server, which is crucial for debugging CORS issues.

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is experiencing CORS issues despite trying to set environment variables. They've shared output from a CORS check endpoint, and it looks like the CORS configuration isn't picking up the environment variables they set. The allowed origins are still showing the default values ("http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000") rather than their custom origins.

They've also shared a link to the Coolify documentation about Docker Compose, which explains how environment variables work in Coolify deployments.

Key points from the documentation:
1. Coolify uses the docker-compose.yml file as the single source of truth
2. Environment variables mentioned in the compose file will be displayed in the Coolify UI
3. Variables can be defined in different ways:
   - Hardcoded values (`SOME_HARDCODED_VALUE=hello`)
   - Variables editable in Coolify UI (`SOME_VARIABLE=${SOME_VARIABLE_IN_COOLIFY_UI}`)
   - Variables with default values editable in UI (`SOME_DEFAULT_VARIABLE=${OTHER_NAME_IN_COOLIFY:-hello}`)

The issue seems to be that their CORS_ORIGINS environment variable isn't being properly passed to the application. Let's think about how to fix this:

1. The output shows that the CORS configuration is still using the default values, which means the environment variable isn't being properly set or read.
2. According to the Coolify docs, they need to make sure the environment variable is properly defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
3. We should check if there's an issue with how the application reads the environment variables.
4. We might need to adjust how the CORS_ORIGINS is handled in the settings.py file.

Let's focus on ensuring that the environment variable is properly set and read by the application when deployed with Coolify.</think>I see the issue now. Based on your CORS check output, your application is still using the default values (`http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`) rather than picking up the environment variables you set in Coolify.

According to the [Coolify documentation on Docker Compose](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/docker/compose), environment variables need to be correctly defined in your docker-compose.yml file so they can be properly passed to your container and managed in the Coolify UI.

Let's add a more comprehensive `/debug/cors` endpoint that shows exactly what's happening with your environment variables:

---

_****_

```diff
  import logging
  from pathlib import Path

  from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter, Request, Depends

+             }
          }
      
```

Now let's check the `config.py` file to make sure it's properly reading environment variables:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

The issue might be related to how Pydantic is handling URL validation for CORS origins. Let's update the config.py file to better handle environment variables in Docker/Coolify:

---

_****_

```diff
      
      # CORS
-     CORS_ORIGINS: List[AnyHttpUrl] = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
+     CORS_ORIGINS: List[str] = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]

-         if isinstance(v, str) and not v.startswith("["):
-             return [i.strip() for i in v.split(",")]
-         elif isinstance(v, (list, str)):
+         if isinstance(v, str):
+             # Handle comma-separated string

+                     import json
+                     return json.loads(v)
+                 except:
+                     pass
+             # Handle single URL
+             return [v]
+         elif isinstance(v, list):
              return v
-         raise ValueError(v)
+         raise ValueError(f"Invalid CORS_ORIGINS format: {v}")
      
      model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env", env_file_encoding="utf-8", case_sensitive=True)
```

---

_****_

Now let's update the CORS middleware in main.py to add more debugging and better handle different formats:

---

_****_

```diff
      # Configure CORS - Proper configuration following best practices
      logger.info(f"Configuring CORS with allowed origins: {settings.CORS_ORIGINS}")
+     # Debug for CORS origins
+     logger.info(f"CORS_ORIGINS from environment: {os.environ.get('CORS_ORIGINS', 'Not set')}")
+     
+     # Ensure CORS_ORIGINS is a list and has valid values
+     cors_origins = settings.CORS_ORIGINS
+     if not isinstance(cors_origins, list):
+         logger.warning(f"CORS_ORIGINS is not a list, converting: {cors_origins}")
+         if isinstance(cors_origins, str):
+             cors_origins = [cors_origins]
+         else:
+             logger.error(f"Invalid CORS_ORIGINS type: {type(cors_origins)}")
+             cors_origins = ["http://localhost:3000"]
+     
+     logger.info(f"Final CORS origins configuration: {cors_origins}")
+     
      application.add_middleware(
          CORSMiddleware,
          # Explicitly list allowed origins - don't use wildcard with credentials
-         allow_origins=settings.CORS_ORIGINS,
+         allow_origins=cors_origins,
          # Only set to True if you need cookies or auth headers
          allow_credentials=False,
```

---

_****_

Now we need to make sure that the docker-compose.yml file is correctly set up to pass the environment variables to the container. Let's look for that file:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "docker-compose.yml" ‚Ä¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

_****_

Let's examine the docker-compose.yml file:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Now I see the issue! In your docker-compose.yml file, the CORS_ORIGINS environment variable is set with JSON syntax:

```yaml
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3088","http://frontend:3000"]
```

But in Coolify, you're likely setting it as a comma-separated string. Let's modify the docker-compose.yml file to use the format that works with Coolify:

---

_****_

```diff
        - ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
        - DEBUG=False
-       - CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3088","http://frontend:3000"]
+       - CORS_ORIGINS=${CORS_ORIGINS:-http://localhost:3088,http://frontend:3000,http://localhost:3000}
      volumes:
        - ./data:/app/data
```

---

_****_

Perfect! I've made several changes to fix the CORS issue:

1. **Updated the config.py file** to better handle different formats of CORS_ORIGINS from environment variables, including:
   - Comma-separated strings
   - JSON-formatted strings
   - Single URLs

2. **Enhanced the CORS middleware setup in main.py** with:
   - More detailed logging
   - Better error handling
   - Validation to ensure the CORS origins are properly formatted

3. **Created a more detailed debugging endpoint** at `/debug/cors` that shows:
   - Current CORS settings
   - Raw environment variables
   - Other application settings

4. **Modified the docker-compose.yml file** to:
   - Use Coolify-compatible environment variable format 
   - Set a default value while making it configurable through Coolify

The key change was in your docker-compose.yml file. It was using a JSON array format for CORS_ORIGINS, but our settings were expecting a comma-separated list. I've updated it to use the Coolify variable substitution format:

```yaml
CORS_ORIGINS=${CORS_ORIGINS:-http://localhost:3088,http://frontend:3000,http://localhost:3000}
```

This format does two things:
1. It makes the CORS_ORIGINS variable configurable in Coolify
2. It provides a default value if not set (everything after the colon)

After deploying these changes, you should:
1. Ensure you've set CORS_ORIGINS in Coolify with your desired values
2. Check the logs after startup to see the CORS origins being used
3. Visit the `/debug/cors` endpoint to verify the configuration is correct

If you continue to have issues, the detailed logging I've added will help diagnose exactly what's happening with the environment variables and CORS configuration.

_**Assistant**_

<think>Looking at the error logs, I can see the specific error message:

```
pydantic_settings.sources.SettingsError: error parsing value for field "CORS_ORIGINS" from source "EnvSettingsSource"
```

The root cause is in the Python traceback:

```
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 2 (char 1)
```

This suggests that the format of the CORS_ORIGINS environment variable is causing a JSON parsing error. Specifically, it seems the environment variable is being treated as a JSON string, but it's not properly formatted as JSON.

Looking at our docker-compose.yml, we have:
```yaml
CORS_ORIGINS=${CORS_ORIGINS:-http://localhost:3088,http://frontend:3000,http://localhost:3000,http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088}
```

The issue is that Pydantic's settings parser is trying to parse complex types (like lists) from environment variables as JSON, but our comma-separated string is not valid JSON. Even though we have a validator that handles comma-separated strings, it's not being reached because Pydantic is trying to parse it as JSON first and failing.

We need to update our config.py file to handle the format more robustly. The current issue is that Pydantic automatically attempts to parse environment variables for list settings as JSON before our validator gets a chance to run.</think>I see the issue in the error logs. The application is having a JSON parsing error when reading the CORS_ORIGINS environment variable:

```
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 2 (char 1)
```

The problem is that Pydantic is trying to parse the comma-separated string as JSON before our custom validator gets a chance to run. Let's fix this by modifying how we handle the CORS_ORIGINS environment variable:
