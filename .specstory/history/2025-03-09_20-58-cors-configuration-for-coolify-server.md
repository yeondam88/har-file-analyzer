## CORS Configuration for Coolify Server (3/9/2025, 8:58:59 PM)

_**User**_

ok we have fixed all issues running on coolify server, but we need to correctly configured CORS setting, so I can add Environment variables on coolify dashboard, but looking at our backend is hardcoded for CORS allow_origins.

so I have added Production Environment Variables 

CORS_ORIGINS = ["http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]

<think>Let's analyze the user's request:

1. They've deployed the application on a Coolify server and need to correctly configure CORS settings.
2. Currently, the CORS settings are hardcoded in the code with only localhost origins allowed:
```python
allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
```
3. The user has added a production environment variable called `CORS_ORIGINS` with values:
```
["http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]
```

My task is to modify the code to use this environment variable instead of the hardcoded values. This will require:

1. Reading the environment variable from settings
2. Modifying the CORS middleware configuration to use the value from settings

First, I need to check if the settings module already has support for CORS_ORIGINS, and if not, I'll need to add it.</think>I'll help you update the CORS configuration to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values. This will make your application more flexible when deployed on different environments like your Coolify server.

First, let's check the current settings configuration to see if we already have support for CORS_ORIGINS:

Let's try looking for the settings module in a more standard location for FastAPI applications:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src ‚Ä¢ **10** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÅ `__pycache__` |
| üìÑ `main.py` |
| üìÅ `services` |
| üìÅ `schemas` |
| üìÅ `api` |
| üìÅ `core` |
| üìÅ `db` |
| üìÅ `models` |
| üìÑ `__init__.py` |
| üìÅ `utils` |

</details>

---

Let's look in the core directory, as this is a common location for settings in FastAPI applications:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/core ‚Ä¢ **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÅ `__pycache__` |
| üìÑ `config.py` |
| üìÑ `security.py` |
| üìÑ `exceptions.py` |
| üìÑ `__init__.py` |

</details>

Perfect! Let's check the config.py file as it's likely where our application settings are defined:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Great! I can see that the configuration is already set up to handle CORS_ORIGINS as an environment variable. The Settings class has:

1. A default value: `CORS_ORIGINS: List[AnyHttpUrl] = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]`
2. A validator that can handle both string and list formats

Now, let's look at how this is used in the main.py file:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

I see the issue now. The main.py file is importing the settings configuration with `from src.core.config import settings`, but in the CORS middleware configuration, it's using hardcoded values instead of the `settings.CORS_ORIGINS` value.

Let's update the CORS configuration in the main.py file to use the settings:

---

_****_

```diff
          CORSMiddleware,
          # Explicitly list allowed origins - don't use wildcard with credentials
-         allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"],
+         allow_origins=settings.CORS_ORIGINS,
          # Only set to True if you need cookies or auth headers
          allow_credentials=False,
```

---

_****_

Perfect! Now your application will use the CORS origins specified in the environment variables instead of the hardcoded values. 

With this change, your Coolify server will accept the CORS_ORIGINS environment variable you've set:
```
CORS_ORIGINS = ["http://wkg08ks0g0cg40sk04gcscwo.5.78.133.23.sslip.io:3088", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000"]
```

The Pydantic settings configuration already has a validator (`assemble_cors_origins`) that will handle this properly, whether it's provided as a comma-separated string or a list.

This change makes your application more configurable and ensures it will work properly in different environments without code changes.

I have added environment variable but still CORS error not fixed. Can we add a log so we can see to read our env for allowed host? hmm but i am thinking if the request blocked by the browser, then where should we see the log (server side env values) 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is experiencing CORS issues even after setting the environment variables. They want to add logging to verify that the correct CORS settings are being applied, but they're also realizing that if the browser is blocking the request (which is what CORS errors do), they might not see server-side logs for those requests.

Let's add logging to the application startup to print the CORS settings that are being used. This way, they can verify that the environment variables are being properly read by the application.

I should:
1. Add logging at application startup to print the CORS origins that are being used
2. Consider adding more verbose CORS error handling or debugging information
3. Explain why they can still see server logs even if CORS blocks browser requests</think>You're right that CORS errors happen on the browser side, but the server still processes the request - it's the browser that blocks the response due to CORS policy violations. This means we can definitely add server-side logging to see what CORS origins are configured.

Let's add detailed logging to show what CORS settings are being used when the application starts up:
